Scored only 81% in accessibility with Lighthouse:

Home Page:

Missing image alt text
LinkedIn icon links do not have a discernible name (for screen readers/if icon doesn't load)
- No nav skip link
- Loose li tags without ul container for credits

Performance points:
Image sizing can be optimised for faster loading
Image formats like WebP and AVIF provide better compression

The carousel image crops badly in certain screen widths.


Review of Marine Page
Excellent content with a good balance of text to images and gifs
Very pleasing colour scheme and consistent layout / header.
Unfortunately on the Marine Page, the header shrinks in size, breaking the immersion. This should be a simple fix and is only noticeable due to the already pleas ing aesthetic.


Image page: Quite good overall but in what world do I imagine cute quirky goats?
